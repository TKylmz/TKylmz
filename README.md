# I'm TK  A Deckhand learning full-stack development

I'm TK, learning full-stack web development while working as a deckhand.
My background in hands-on, real-world work shapes how I approach code: practical, detail-oriented, and focused on solving real problems.
This GitHub is where I document what I learn and build small projects as I go.

## Using

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git, VS Code

## Learning

- React, Node.js, Express
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Docker

## Current Focus

Working on JavaScript fundamentals and building small web applications.

## Projects

- [FullStack Progress](https://github.com/TKylmz/FullStack-Progress)  Repository for notes, projects, and templates as I learn.
- [TKLocalAI](https://github.com/TKylmz/TKLocalAI)  Local AI Assistant with GPU acceleration, RAG, and LoRA fine-tuning. Fully private, runs on your hardware.
